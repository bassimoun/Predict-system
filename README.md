# predict-system
The system will combine between rational numbers in database of examination and ultrasound images. In England, the midwife is the person that take care of pregnant women. The system will target the inexpert people such as (Midwife, Nurse, â€¦etc.) to support them to predict pregnant women deliver (caesarean and natural birth), the goal of both delivery approaches is to carefully give birth to a healthy baby. Likewise, it will reduce the multiple visits for ultrasound examinations because of its high cost and too dangerous on women and their babies. All women will have the option to choose between the real examination or this hybrid system.



This system use three type of machine learning (Artificial neural network, Support Vector Machine for classifying dataset and Convolutional Neural Network  for classifying images) "This code at classifier folder"


Ces_Norm_Classification "This GUI for runnig ANN and SVM classifiers"
Ultrasound_reg "This GUI for running CNN classifer"
